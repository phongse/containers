_An opinionated collection of container images_

</div>

Welcome to our container images! If you are looking for a container, start by [browsing the GitHub Packages page for this repository's packages](https://github.com/phongse/containers/packages).

## Mission Statement

Our goal is to provide [semantically versioned](https://semver.org/), [rootless](https://rootlesscontaine.rs/), and [multi-architecture](https://www.docker.com/blog/multi-arch-build-and-images-the-simple-way/) containers for various applications.

We adhere to the [KISS principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle), logging to stdout, maintaining [one process per container](https://testdriven.io/tips/59de3279-4a2d-4556-9cd0-b444249ed31e/), avoiding tools like [s6-overlay](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay), and building all images on top of our Alpine base image.

## Credits

This repository draws inspiration and ideas from the [home-ops community](https://github.com/home-operations).
